Even to this day, the growth is still in its exponential phase, currently with about 644 million active websites. As platforms and frameworks become more widespread, even more websites continue to flood the internet. Wordpress, which began as a blogging platform, has evolved to the point where it can functionÂ as a regular website. Some web applications are even ran on Wordpress. With so many different types of sites, how do we categorize each type?
<h2>Landing Page</h2>
&nbsp;

Catchy headlines and promising descriptions are common to a landing page, in order to draw their attentions and interests. Such pages are the life and blood of online businesses, as it is the final step a user performs before spending money. If you are selling products or services, be sure to have a simple and clean landing page to help you with conversion.

<h2>Content Website</h2>
Most websites are considered content websites. Such siteÂ usually contains multiple pages like the Homepage, About Us, Products, Services, Contact. Content websites are good for personal portfolios including artists, musicians,Â web freelancers, photographers, and such. Local small businesses can also have a website to show customers who they are and what they do. A website is extremely versatile as you can add a Blog page to it as well. A landing page could also be built in on one of the pages (while you would want to hide some navigation items to avoid distracting the users from the end goal). Websites will cost more than a landing page because of the extra pages, but having a website for any small business is highly recommended in our modern age.
<h2>E-Commerce</h2>

As you can tell from the name, e-commerce site are sites that are capable of handling purchases and payments. You generally have a list of products with buttons to add to your shopping cart, and a checkout button that takes you to the payment page. These sites start with pre-made platforms, and are customized to suit the clients needs. Common platforms include Shopify, Magento, and WooCommerce. There's always an admin backend for sales and payment management. After a developer sets the site up, you don't have to deal with any code when using the admin panel. In order to take payments securely, the site requires an SSL certificate. These certificates provide better data encryption and hides it from potentialÂ hackers.

<h2>Webapps</h2>
Webapps are apps for the web. They do more than just showing content or blogs. Webapps help you perform tasks and automate things.Â There are services that provide email analytics like email open rates, send success rates, and user agents information. Sites like Postmark &amp; Sendgrid provide these services when you sign up to their site. These sites are much more complicated and require a team of developers to create. They are essential apps, the only difference is that you access them on a browser instead of on your phone or tablet.

If you are a small business owner, you'llÂ want a content website as a business front for the internet. Here you can provide some information on what products or services you provide. A contact page will provide an easy to use email form for users with questions. If you happen to have products, you'll want this website to have e-commerce capabilities. You may create a separate site for shopping, or just make your e-commerce site your content website as well. Once you have your primary site set up, you can create ad campaigns with landing pages set up to help with conversion rates. You generally won't need a webapp unless your company is providing software as a service or SAAS.";s:10:"post_title";s:52:"What are the Major Types and Categories of Websites?";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:5:"draft";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:24:"different-types-websites";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2016-04-13 03:02:16";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2016-04-13 03:02:16";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:34:"https://codelabstudios.dev/?p=3413";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
