</br>Even though many aspects of businesses are becoming automated, customer relations are one thing which canâ€™t be automated without being easily noticeable.

Within minutes of a customer alerting you of their unhappiness towards your service, they can quickly publish their (albeit unwanted) opinion to social media and tarnish the reputation which youâ€™ve carefully built up.

<a href="">Because of this, if you havenâ€™t done so already, then you should prioritise the relationships which you have with your customers.

With that, below we have put together 6 of the best ways to make customers love your business as well as increase the number of customers that you receive.
#1 â€“ Interact With Your Customers
As we mentioned above, businesses are beginning to be automated and so they are missing out on the â€œpersonalâ€ level of their service. Although automation can be helpful, thereâ€™s one thing that it wonâ€™t help you with. Interacting with your customers.
Actually interacting with your customers rather than just providing them with a service is important as it goes to show that you genuinely care about providing a top-notch service and letâ€™s face it, if you donâ€™t interact with your customers then youâ€™re going to lose potential clients and fail as a business.
On top of that, donâ€™t talk to them like a robot. Youâ€™re not talking to the press or publishing a scientific study, so speak to them as if they were in front of you and you are having a conversation. Make them feel like you care about their needs and what theyâ€™re looking for in a business, and youâ€™ll undoubtedly have a long-time customer.
#2 â€“ Listen to Your Customers
A lot of businesses nowadays have become egotistical and disregard customer feedback due to the fact that it isnâ€™t a professional opinion. Although this is true, customer feedback can help you to improve your everyday business and find out what it was that your customers liked about the service which you provide, as well as the things they didnâ€™t like.
There are a few different ways to get feedback from customers youâ€™ve dealt with, such as:
â€¢	Social media pages
â€¢	Asking potential customers through relevant communities
â€¢	Simply asking customers who youâ€™ve worked with in the past
â€¢	Emailing customers which a survey which is relevant to the service that you provided them with
These are just a few of the most effective ways to gather helpful feedback to improve your service overall, and ultimately increase your customer count.
#3 â€“ Provide Transparency
Customers want to know everything about your business and they donâ€™t want to jump through hoops just to find out details about you that they should otherwise know. Because of that, transparency is something which is expected from businesses nowadays. This is especially important for online businesses.
What does it mean for a business to be transparent?
â€¢	Transparency is when you donâ€™t avoid your customers.
â€¢	Transparency is when you welcome any feedback which you receive from your customers.
â€¢	Transparency is when you and your employees donâ€™t have to alter your personalities at work.
â€¢	Transparency is when you donâ€™t have anything to hide.
Given that there are still businesses out there who donâ€™t provide transparency, by incorporating it into your business and having nothing to hide, youâ€™re giving yourself a leg up over your competitors.
#4 â€“ Keep Your Word
Continuing up on the previous point, keeping your word and not letting your customer down helps to build trust between you and your customers. If you make promises which you yourself are unsure about, or which you know you canâ€™t keep, then your customers will lose trust in you and will know that you arenâ€™t a reliable business to deal with.
â€œYour word is your bond.â€ â€“ Melvyn Douglas
If you arenâ€™t able to keep a promise that you are going to make, cut yourself off and donâ€™t make that promise. If you arenâ€™t able to meet your customerâ€™s deadline, let them know before itâ€™s too late.
Be comfortable with the work that you take on, donâ€™t take on more work than you or your business is not capable of completing in the timespan which is provided, and complete it to your best standard. By doing this your customers will see you as a reliable business who they can trust and will return to you in the future.
#5 â€“ Relax and Respect
Around 1 in every 3 customers have said that they have experienced rude customer service a minimum of once a month. Following this, roughly 58-percent of these people will tell their friends about this rude experience.
Word of mouth has always been, and will also be, an effective way of marketing. However, there is such as a thing as bad word of mouth and this is a prime example of it. If you find that your employees are rude or that you could be more pleasant when dealing with customers, itâ€™s in your best interests to deal with it effectively.
Every business has customers who arenâ€™t the easiest to work with although this is the sort of thing that you have to have patience for, relax, and deal with appropriately. If you relax and come to an outcome which suits both you and the problematic customer, youâ€™ll both leave somewhat satisfied.
By having respect for your customers and dealing with the issues that they have, theyâ€™ll provide you with â€œgood word of mouthâ€.
#6 â€“ Be a Pleasure to Work With
The last thing that weâ€™re going to discuss is your attitude. Always have a positive attitude when it comes to your business and donâ€™t let your personal life get involved with your work. This can cause your business to take a hit if your anger is misdirected, and this is often not something which you can recover from easily.
If you are in need of more details from a customer to get started on the service you are providing, always say â€œPleaseâ€. When they get back to you or compliment the work which youâ€™ve done for them, always say â€œThank Youâ€. These may seem like basic manners although they can really go a long way.
Appreciate your customers and theyâ€™ll appreciate you.
