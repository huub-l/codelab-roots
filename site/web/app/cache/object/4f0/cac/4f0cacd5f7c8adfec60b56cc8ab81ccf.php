Before we jump into the tips, I want to talk about why it is the fourth builder of you before we jump into the tips, I want to talk about why it is important to be building your email list everyday

Why is email important for my business?

Having someone who might be interested in your services give you your email, is now more valuable than ever. I would rather have 1000 emails of potential prospects, than 5000 home addresses of the same prospects to send physical mail to.

Tactic #1
Offer a discount on your services

If you were in the low ticket industry, offering a discount on your products or even in some cases a free product, is a great way to get your customers to visit your website with an ad or opt in the email so that you can target them later.

If you're hoping that people will care to opt into your newsletter without you offering anything additional to that, you're going to be sadly mistaken these days.

From AB test we've run where we had email often forms offering nothing other than just updates and tips compared to opt in form is offering things such as a free download of some digital content, we saw often rates jumped by at least 5x.

This percentage increase varies depending on the industry, but overall giving something valuable to the consumer in exchange for them giving you their email, produces significantly more opt ins.

Tactic #2
Host an old-fashioned giveaway

When you see those ads on Facebook giving away free things, (usually electronics), take a second to look at that next time. You're going to fine they want something in return, usually it's an email, share, or like.

Now let's take it a step further rather than giving away just a free iPhone or something meaningless like that. Give away something that your ideal customers would want.

You might need to get a little creative.

If you're in the automotive industry, give away a new set of tires. If you're in the home remodeling space, give away a brand-new bathroom remodel. If you were in the restaurant industry (which is a little easier because who doesn't like to eat), offer a free dinner to one lucky winner.

Depending on if you do your marketing right, this can generate hundreds if not thousands of people that would be interested in your product or service. You can quickly see how that would easily cover the cost of the prize to the winner.


Tactic #3
 include a downloadable PDF of whatever topic it is your blogging about

This one works very well too, especially if you're in the high ticket industry.

Let's say you do plumbing and HVAC.

A great example of this would be a 15 point checklist of things you can do as a homeowner to prevent damage to your plumbing and HVAC system.

Some of you might be thinking right now, "But why would I tell my potential customers how not to need me?".

Easy.

Guess who's going to be top of mind when something does go wrong with their plumbing or HVAC?

Joe Schmo's Plumbing on Yelp?

Or you, the person who gave them a free resource without asking for anything but an email, and have been periodically providing free preventative care value to them via email?

The goal is to make yourself be the person I think about when they might need your services.


Tactic #3
Host a giveaway

 Regardless of your industry, I'm sure there is something that you can find valuable to your potential customers to give away for free. Giveaways are not a thing of the past, they have worked extremely well for some of our clients.

Let's say you're in the home inspection industry. You could be giving away a free home inspection to one person who enters.
