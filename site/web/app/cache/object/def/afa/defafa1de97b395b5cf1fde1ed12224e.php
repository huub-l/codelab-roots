So if youâ€™re interested in advertising on Facebook in 2017, youÂ <strong>should first know</strong>Â about Facebook Remarketing, Why itâ€™s amazing, and how to utilize it. Iâ€™ll explain all of this for you below.

<strong><u>The quickest way to explain it is with this example;</u>â€“</strong>

Imagine you walked into your local coffee shop today.

For some reason you didnâ€™t buy anything, maybe you had to take a call, your house was on fire, it can be anything. You left the shop.

That coffee shop lost a potential customer.Â <strong>Until now.</strong>

As youâ€™re on your way home, all the billboards you pass by, actually have your local coffee shop advertising on them.

Not only are you seeing their ads but youâ€™re seeing offers that areÂ <strong>relevant and enticing to you</strong>Â â€“ the potential customer.

</div>
<blockquote>Now that business has more plenty of opportunities to bring you back in as a customer. Itâ€™s a game-changer.</blockquote>
<div id="x-section-1" class="x-section">
<div class="x-container max width">
<div class="x-column x-sm x-1-1">
<div class="x-text">

Basically, Facebook can do just this, except for online advertising (and even offline to some degree).

<h2 id="Remarketing">What is Facebook Remarketing?</h2>
<strong>Facebook Remarketing refers to the strategy of displaying ads, offers, and discounts, to people that have visited your websiteÂ </strong>(making them potential customers),<strong>Â while theyâ€™re browsing Facebook</strong>.

You can even display ads to people who have purchased from you in the past. Display up-sells, cross-sells, etc and bring them back to your site every time.

Anyone that visitâ€™s your website can automatically be put into whatâ€™s called aÂ <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/341425252616329"><strong>Facebook Custom Audience</strong></a>Â (and then into a Remarketing List).
<blockquote><span class="box"><span id="item"><a href="https://emailoctopus.com/">What is a Facebook Custom Audience?</a></span>
â€œA Custom Audience from a customer list is a type of audience you can create made up of your existing customers. You can target ads to the audience youâ€™ve created on Facebook, Instagram, and Audience Network.â€</span>

<hr />

<h2 id="Importance">Why is this so important?</h2>
Now hereâ€™s the fun part.

<strong>Anytime someone visits your website, they are anonymously saved to your custom audience.</strong>

<strong>Then, the next time they are on Facebook, they are going to see YOUR ADS in their news feed or side bar.</strong>

Most people are on Facebook at some point these days, including your target customer, roughlyÂ <strong>2 billion people/monthÂ </strong>log on.

So these people seeing your ads are going to beÂ <strong>very likely to purchase or sign up</strong>Â because theyâ€™ve already been to your website and are most likely interested in what you have to offer.
<h2 id="GetStarted">How to Get Started</h2>
In order to build a custom audience from people who have purchased from you orÂ <strong>visited your website</strong>Â (which are some of the best kind of people by the way â€“ it makes sense, theyâ€™ve raised their hand and shown an interest in what you have to offer as a business), you need install aÂ <strong>Facebook Pixel</strong>.
