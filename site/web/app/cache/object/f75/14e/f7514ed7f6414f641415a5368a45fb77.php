We basically rarely ever SSH into the server with the terminal or use SFTP to upload files (at least you shouldn't, git version control is a much better way to deploy your files to the cloud).

So here's what happened. My Macbook Pro's flash SSD died on me, and my Time Machine was not connected to my home network for months and I hadn't notice. I lost lots of files, but most importantly, my ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh_id_rsa.pub were missing too! I made no backups on Google Drive or Dropbox because it's not secure practice to do that. But what are the chances someone's going to steal my key from the cloud, and also know the IP address of my Digital Ocean servers. In hindsight, I should have just backed them up. Actually there's a popular repo Mackup, which is a tool that syncs your Mac settings to dropbox. Settings could include your ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_profile, keyboard bindings, etc. They had backed up ~/.ssh directory by default, but after some people saying that isn't a good practice, they ignored that directory since then.

First step is to log into your Digital Ocean account, then click on the 'Access Console' button. You'll be given a prompt asking for your login. Username is "root", and password is your server password. You can request a new password if you forgot your old once. Once you login, you'll want to navigate to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.

This file stores all the public keys that could access the server.";s:10:"post_title";s:53:"How to regain SSH access to your Digital Ocean server";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:5:"draft";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:38:"regain-ssh-access-digital-ocean-server";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2017-08-26 02:37:43";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2017-08-26 02:37:43";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:34:"https://codelabstudios.dev/?p=4357";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
