Although automation can be helpful, thereu2019s one thing that it wonu2019t help you with. Interacting with your customers.nActually interacting with your customers rather than just providing them with a service is important as it goes to show that you genuinely care about providing a top-notch service and letu2019s face it, if you donu2019t interact with your customers then youu2019re going to lose potential clients and fail as a business.nOn top of that, donu2019t talk to them like a robot. Youu2019re not talking to the press or publishing a scientific study, so speak to them as if they were in front of you and you are having a conversation. Make them feel like you care about their needs and what theyu2019re looking for in a business, and youu2019ll undoubtedly have a long-time customer.n#2 u2013 Listen to Your CustomersnA lot of businesses nowadays have become egotistical and disregard customer feedback due to the fact that it isnu2019t a professional opinion. Although this is true, customer feedback can help you to improve your everyday business and find out what it was that your customers liked about the service which you provide, as well as the things they didnu2019t like.nThere are a few different ways to get feedback from customers youu2019ve dealt with, such as:nu2022tSocial media pagesnu2022tAsking potential customers through relevant communitiesnu2022tSimply asking customers who youu2019ve worked with in the pastnu2022tEmailing customers which a survey which is relevant to the service that you provided them withnThese are just a few of the most effective ways to gather helpful feedback to improve your service overall, and ultimately increase your customer count.n#3 u2013 Provide TransparencynCustomers want to know everything about your business and they donu2019t want to jump through hoops just to find out details about you that they should otherwise know. Because of that, transparency is something which is expected from businesses nowadays. This is especially important for online businesses.nWhat does it mean for a business to be transparent?nu2022tTransparency is when you donu2019t avoid your customers.nu2022tTransparency is when you welcome any feedback which you receive from your customers.nu2022tTransparency is when you and your employees donu2019t have to alter your personalities at work.nu2022tTransparency is when you donu2019t have anything to hide.nGiven that there are still businesses out there who donu2019t provide transparency, by incorporating it into your business and having nothing to hide, youu2019re giving yourself a leg up over your competitors. n#4 u2013 Keep Your WordnContinuing up on the previous point, keeping your word and not letting your customer down helps to build trust between you and your customers. If you make promises which you yourself are unsure about, or which you know you canu2019t keep, then your customers will lose trust in you and will know that you arenu2019t a reliable business to deal with.nu201cYour word is your bond.u201d u2013 Melvyn DouglasnIf you arenu2019t able to keep a promise that you are going to make, cut yourself off and donu2019t make that promise. If you arenu2019t able to meet your customeru2019s deadline, let them know before itu2019s too late.nBe comfortable with the work that you take on, donu2019t take on more work than you or your busine
ss is not capable of completing in the timespan which is provided, and complete it to your best standard. By doing this your customers will see you as a reliable business who they can trust and will return to you in the future.n#5 u2013 Relax and RespectnAround 1 in every 3 customers have said that they have experienced rude customer service a minimum of once a month. Following this, roughly 58-percent of these people will tell their friends about this rude experience.nWord of mouth has always been, and will also be, an effective way of marketing. However, there is such as a thing as bad word of mouth and this is a prime example of it. If you find that your employees are rude or that you could be more pleasant when dealing with customers, itu2019s in your best interests to deal with it effectively.nEvery business has customers who arenu2019t the easiest to work with although this is the sort of thing that you have to have patience for, relax, and deal with appropriately. If you relax and come to an outcome which suits both you and the problematic customer, youu2019ll both leave somewhat satisfied.nBy having respect for your customers and dealing with the issues that they have, theyu2019ll provide you with u201cgood word of mouthu201d. n#6 u2013 Be a Pleasure to Work WithnThe last thing that weu2019re going to discuss is your attitude. Always have a positive attitude when it comes to your business and donu2019t let your personal life get involved with your work. This can cause your business to take a hit if your anger is misdirected, and this is often not something which you can recover from easily.nIf you are in need of more details from a customer to get started on the service you are providing, always say u201cPleaseu201d. When they get back to you or compliment the work which youu2019ve done for them, always say u201cThank Youu201d. These may seem like basic manners although they can really go a long way.nAppreciate your customers and theyu2019ll appreciate you.n"}]},{"_type":"column","size":"1/1","_active":false,"elements":[]},{"_type":"column","size":"1/1","_active":false,"elements":[]},{"_type":"column","size":"1/1","_active":false,"elements":[]},{"_type":"column","size":"1/1","_active":false,"elements":[]},{"_type":"column","size":"1/1","_active":false,"elements":[]}]}],"padding":["px","0px","45px","0px","unlinked"]}]";}s:20:"_cornerstone_excerpt";a:1:{i:0;s:826:"Within minutes of a customer alerting you of their unhappiness towards your service, they can quickly publish their (albeit unwanted) opinion to social media and tarnish the reputation which you‚Äôve carefully built up.
