<strong>Traditional marketing </strong>incorporates several forms of both advertising and marketing. Most well-known tactics include advertisements that most of us see and hear every single day. These include:
<ul>
	<li>Print</li>
	<li>Broadcasting</li>
	<li>Telephone (cold-calling)</li>
	<li>Direct Mail Advertisements</li>
</ul>
Print marketing is the most familiar and the oldest form of marketing. Beginning with traditional newspaper ads, print advertisements continue to find their way in front of us even some 150 years after their invention.

Broadcast ads include radio advertisements and television commercials. Specialized forms of broadcast ads include movie theater ads.

<strong>Telephone marketing</strong>â€”or telemarketingâ€”is another popular form of advertisement. While not the most popular, it continues to make an impact.

Direct mail advertisements include fliers, postcards, letters or any other material that is directly mailed to potential consumers.
<h2>What is digital marketing?</h2>
<strong>Digital marketing is</strong> the new wave of advertising. It too is an umbrella term defined by the medium through which marketers push either digital technologies or offline products that can easily be marketed online.

Examples of <strong>digital marketing</strong> include websites, social networking sites, content marketing, video marketing, Google ads, and banner ads.

Digital marketing enables marketers to monitor the effectiveness of their ads, what is being viewed most, sales conversion, what content is working and what isnâ€™t all with the click of a mouse.
<h2>Cost for traditional marketing vs digital marketing</h2>
<strong>Traditional marketing</strong> continues to be a major player in consumer advertising. Despite this, many startups struggle with the costs associated with the strategy. For example, to take out a full page spread ad in a magazine (a common form of traditional advertising) youâ€™re looking at anywhere from $5,000-$10,000 and in some cases even more than that. A broadcast ad might cost $150, but your reach isnâ€™t likely to be as stunning.

<strong>Digital marketing</strong> is the new kid on the block, and highly respected by a large and small companies alike. The costs for <strong>online marketing</strong> vary greatly. For example, you can sign-up for social media campaigns that cost around $75 a month to reach thousands of people. Additionally, you could hire an SEO firm to market your website and do all the hard work for you and pay around $1,500 a month for full-service digital marketing. Youâ€™ll reach hundreds of thousandsâ€”possibly millionsâ€”of consumers and have a better chance of converting them as well.
<h3>Content distribution and audience outreach</h3>
Content distribution is based on how many people you can reach with a particular form of advertising. If youâ€™re using <strong>traditional marketing</strong> methods, your reach is either based on A) your ability to physically distribute ads and filers to the right audience or B) the reach of the form of media you are using. Print, broadcasting, and even television viewing to some extent, have greatly reduced over the past decade. Audiences are turning to digital media for content.

<strong>Digital marketing</strong> has a different outlook. If you spend around $75 for social media ads, you can reach at least 2,000 people quickly. Compare that with traditional marketing, and you can expect to pay a minimum of $150 for the same reach.
<h3>Conversion rate and effectiveness</h3>
<strong>Digital marketing</strong> outpaces <strong>traditional marketing</strong> within conversion rates and overall effectiveness. An Inbound Report conducted by HubPages, noted that 54% more leads are generated by inbound tactics (digital marketing) than by traditional paid advertising. Content marketing (or <strong>online marketing</strong>) is also shown to generate 3 times more leads as traditional marketing methods, and the kicker is it costs upwards of 62% less.";s:10:"post_title";s:43:"Traditional Marketing vs. Digital Marketing";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:5:"draft";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:42:"traditional-marketing-vs-digital-marketing";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2016-07-18 18:08:56";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2016-07-18 18:08:56";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:34:"https://codelabstudios.dev/?p=3446";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
